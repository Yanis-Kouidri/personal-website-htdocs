        <h2> How I made this website ? </h2>
        <p class="block">
            The whole website is <strong>handmade</strong>. By handmade, I mean written by myself in <em>HTML 5</em> and <em>CSS 3</em>. 
            For the record, I first started by using the website <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wix.com/">WIX.com</a>. 
            Only, when I wanted to add a video, I didn't succeed in applying control buttons. I didn't like it and I decided to go back to the HTML and CSS that I already experienced before. 
            I took a training on <a target="_blank" href="https://openclassrooms.com/fr/">OpenClassrooms</a> to refresh my memory and I started to code the site using the well named Visual Studio Code. 
            It was probably more tedious than using Wix, but at least I knew what I was doing from A to Z. 
            <strong> Writing code is always more precise than doing drag and drop. </strong>

            <img src="./medias/images/Logo/CSS3_HTML5.png" alt="Logo de validation HTML 5 et CSS 3" id="logo_html_css" title="HTML 5 and CSS 3 logo">
            Moreover, I had my site <strong>validated</strong> by the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> (World Wide Web Consortium). This means that my site correctly respects the current <em>web standards</em>.
