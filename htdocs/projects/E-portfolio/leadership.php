        <h3> Manager vs Leader </h3>

        <p class="block">
            Nowadays, it’s important to be a leader. A lot of work needs leadership skills. 
            Firstly, I will give you my definition of leadership. 
            For me, leadership is the ability of a person to inspire, motivate and guide a group toward a common goal. 
            That involves a lot of different skills such as communication, problem-solving, decision-making, strategic thinking, trust building, and the ability to motivate a group. 
            That also requires to well know the subject and the objective. 
            Leadership is a cross-disciplinary skill whereas a manager is just a position in a company. 
            A manager can do his work without being a leader. 
            Of course, a manager will be better if he has leadership skills. 
            I heard a story where some managers didn’t know what a terminal is in IT companies.

        <h3> Interview </h3>
        <p class="block">
        To know more about the leader, I contact Mohamed Touré, a test leader at Bouygues Telecom. 
        He explains to me his job, specifically the leadership part. 
        Interestingly, he doesn’t want to be a manager but only a leader. 
        So, he doesn’t deal with managing tasks like administration, budget planning, allocation of resources, etc. but focuses on leading tasks.
        </p>

        <p class="block">
            I can see myself in his job because like Mohamed I don't want to spend time doing administrative work, giving orders, being accountable or even imposing my authority. 
            I prefer to lead a project, find solutions, and resolve conflicts so that my team is satisfied with the project it is working on and happy to carry it out. 
            On the one hand, this treatment is much more humane, and on the other hand, I am convinced that people who are happy to work on a project work better knowing that at any moment they have their say.

        <h3> Danger </h3>

        <p class="block">
            Management is an important aspect of companies. Bad management can have heavy repercussions. 
            I am thinking of the <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affaire_France_T%C3%A9l%C3%A9com" target="_blank" >"France Telecom" affair</a>, 
            between 2006 and 2011 the French telecommunications company "France Telecom" introduced management by fear that pushed 35 employees to suicide in addition to being the cause of many mental disorders for employees (depression, anxiety, etc.). 
            It is therefore essential that managers be trained to adopt good team management.
        </p>

        <h3> Myself </h3>

        <p class="block">
            I like to be a leader and I would like to be one in a company. Being a leader is for me something really <strong>rewarding</strong> that brings a lot of different skills as I mentioned previously. 
            Moreover, I have the feeling to be the captain of a boat that I must take somewhere. We are all in the same boat, if it seeks, we all seek. 
            The feeling of accomplishment once the project is completed is immense and makes you want to start another project considering the results of the previous one.

        <h2> Diversity </h2>
        <h3> Benefit </h3>

        <p class="block">
            Now we have a clear point of view on what leadership is, we can go deeper into this theme and talk about diversity. 
            When all your colleagues are salespersons, their pieces of advice are TV adverts. 
            This sentence means you can’t expect similar people to have different ideas. 
            This is also true in nature, individuals with similar genetics are more vulnerable to epidemics. 
            This picture summarizes all.

        <h3> Fresco of diversity </h3>
        <p class="block">
            However, diversity isn’t an easy concept to implement in a company or, more generally in a society. 
            To understand why, I did, with some classmates, a fresco of diversity. 
            That consist of a set of cards that we had to place on a board and create a circuit through different groups of cards that we decide to associate. 
            Here’s ore board.

        <h4> Biases </h4>
        <p class="block">
            Firstly, we can see that humans have a lot of bias. 
            Bias refers to a preference, inclination, or prejudice towards or against a particular person, group, thing, or idea. 
            It is a tendency to favor or disfavor one option over another, often without rational justification. 
            Bias can be conscious or unconscious and can manifest in various ways, such as in attitudes, beliefs, stereotypes, behaviors, and decision-making. 
            It can be influenced by a range of factors, including personal experiences, cultural background, social norms, and cognitive processes. 
            It’s hard to be aware of all biases and counter them. All these biases are the source of discrimination based on name, age, sexual identity, sex, sexual orientation, wealth, physical appearance, etc. 
            It’s important to mention that all these discriminations are not necessarily intentional and can be unconscious.
        </p>

        <h4> Consequences </h4>
        <p class="block">
            They lead to a lot of bad consequences like privilege, non-diversity, exclusion, lack of innovation, etc. 
            We decide to set apart some cards that represent for us some pseudo-solution. 
            Why pseudo, because they can temporarily correct the problem but not deeply. 
            For example, imposing quotas on companies can afford diversity but a which cost? 
            Hiring a person for filling quotas is extremely degrading for the hired person because it means “I don’t hire you for your skills but for your sex (or ethnical origin, or handicap, etc.).”.
        </p>

        <h4> Personal reflection </h4>
        <p class="block">
            We need to keep in mind that people are different, and we can’t force them to go into specific sectors. 
            For example, it is easy to see that jobs related to the technology or finance sectors are often held by men. On the other hand, jobs related to care or childhood are often done by women. 
            You may think that this is due to patriarchy or some other social construction, but the studies carried out on this subject do not support this view. 
            In fact, in the most advanced countries in the world in terms of gender equality, namely Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, we notice the biggest gender disparities, with women going into care and social professions much more than into technical or scientific professions. 
            These differences in orientation can therefore be explained by biological differences. This also explains the differences in salary between men and women. 
            To learn more about this subject, here is the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20190831-the-paradox-of-working-in-the-worlds-most-equal-countries" target="_blank">link to the study</a>.
            However, it is important to keep in mind that we are talking about the average here, there are many very competent women in the fields of technology and science as well as men who are very involved in the social and care professions.
            The purpose of my reflection is to alert us to certain practices that are supposed to solve the problem of diversity, but whose concrete effect is not the one expected.

        <h3> The devil wears Prada </h3>
        <p  class="block">
            
            I watch two films that I can link to this module. The first is “The devil wears Prada”. 
            It tells the story of Andrea, a young graduate starting a new job in the fashion industry. 
            She will quickly discover that this environment is ruthless and must make a place for herself. 
            We find ideas of Leadership, often pushed to the extreme. It also shows the difficulty of certain choices between her professional career and her private life or the respect for her values at work. 
            I liked it a lot.

        <p> <img src="./medias/images/Leadership/La_Haine_affiche.jpg" alt="The poster of the french Movie La Haine" class="float_left"> </p>
        <h3 class="clear_right"> La Haine </h3>
        <p class="block">
            The second is called "La Haine", it follows the daily life of 3 young people in a French city, a Jew, a black, and an Arab following a riot that left a serious injury. 
            It contrasts the views of the police and the inhabitants of the neighborhood. 
            This film was inspired by real events and brought to the forefront the daily life of these suburbs.
