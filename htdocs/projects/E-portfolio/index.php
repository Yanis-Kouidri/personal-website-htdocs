            <h2> About me</h2>
            <p class="block">
                Currently in my second year at the French engineering school ENSEEIHT in the field of Digital Sciences (Sciences du Numérique) program, alternating with Thales Alenia Space Toulouse. 
                I see the position of apprentice engineer as a job that combines knowledge, know-how and interpersonal skills. 
                In my opinion, it is important to plan a project well in order to understand the ins and outs in order to be able to carry out the technical tasks efficiently. 
                The field of competence of an engineer in Digital Sciences is quite large, going from computer science to telecommunications and network. 
                My solid training will allow me to reach the objectives set by the company, in particular thanks to my practical skills but also thanks to my know-how. 
                Moreover, I am a sociable person, showing good mood and knowing how to adapt to the various situations.

        <h2> My background </h2>
        <p class="block">Not knowing exactly what I wanted to do later on, I chose to do a scientific baccalaureate with a biology option because it opens all doors. 
            Once I got my baccalaureate, I went to a DUT (University Diploma of Technology over 2 years) Networks and Telecommunications. 
            I chose this diploma because it allows me to develop skills on a wide range of topics related to computer science with a very present practical side. 
            Once I obtained my DUT, I chose to continue my studies at ENSEEIHT (French engineering school located in Toulouse) in order to obtain an engineering degree in Digital Sciences, 
            all of this in a work-study program at Thales Alenia Space. The number one criterion when I chose my school at the end of the DUT was to be able to do a work-study program. 
            I chose the N7 (abbreviation of ENSEEIHT) because it was recommended to me by teachers of my DUT as well as former students of my DUT.  I do not regret this choice at all. 
            At the moment, I still don't know exactly what I want to do once I get my engineering diploma. I am interested in a PhD and also in the VIE (Volontariat International en Entreprise). 
            My best ally to orient myself is of course the discussion with professionals close to my field.
