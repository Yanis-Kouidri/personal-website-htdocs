        <h2> How I fit in professionally ? </h2>
        <p class="block">
            First, I have a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yanis-kouidri/">Linkedin page</a> on which I regularly update my information. 
            As soon as I pass a <strong>certification</strong>, participate in a <strong>project</strong>, get an <strong>internship</strong>, I add it to my Linkedin account. 
            This way, I increase my chances of being found, especially during <strong>keyword</strong> searches. 
            Moreover, I have adopted the reflex to always add new people I meet in a professional or academic environment. 
            Don't hesitate to do the same with me.
        </p>
        <p class="block">
            Secondly, I participate as much as possible in different <strong>events</strong> related to my field. 
            This advice was given to me by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sylvainlareyre/">Sylvain Lareyre</a> when I was doing my DUT in networks and telecoms at Sophia Antipolis. 
            At all professional events, there are recruiters, and even if there aren't any, it's always an opportunity to be <strong>spotted</strong> and with word of mouth, things go fast. <br>
            I personally participated in the <strong> AWS Cloud Tour Roadshow 2022 </strong> in Toulouse. 
            In addition to enjoying a good buffet for free, I was able to meet many industry professionals and discover more about what Amazon Web Service offers on the cloud.
        </p>

        <p class="block">
            Finally, I do not hesitate to <strong> discuss </strong> with people, to <strong> ask questions</strong>, to <strong>ask for advice</strong>. <em>Nobody will refuse to give you advice. </em>
            This advice is even more valuable when it comes from experienced people, they will be able to tell you where they succeeded and where it did not work so well. 
            In addition, by asking questions, you will show that you are interested in the person in question, so they will more easily <strong>recommend you</strong> to HR or think of you when the opportunity arises.
            To interact with professionals, I use the <a target="_blank" href="https://app.myjobglasses.com">MyJobsGlasses</a> tool that connects young people like me with professionals from all walks of life.

        <p class="block">
            <a target="_blank" href="https://app.myjobglasses.com">My Jobs Glasses</a> is a professional network, <strong>easy to use</strong> and <strong>free</strong>. It connects young people like me with professionals from all walks of life. 
            It is then possible to make an appointment, face to face or by video, and to discuss what you want with the professional. 
            It's more friendly than simply by email or text message.
            Personally, I have, for the moment, used this site to discuss with 2 people working in very different environments. 
            It was very interesting and I intend to continue to use it as soon as I have some time.
