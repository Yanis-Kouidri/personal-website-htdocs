        <h2> Sport </h2>
        <h3> Sea side </h3>
        <p class="block">
            I was lucky enough to grow up near the sea and so was able to practice many different sports. I was able to do catamaran, windsurfing, stand-up paddle, some kite-surfing and wing foil. 
            What I have with these sports, it is that we feel free, we slide on a stretch of water almost infinite, we go where we want and we stop when we want. 
            This feeling of freedom requires some preparation, you have to take the equipment out, drive to the beach, assemble the equipment, inflate the sail but I think it's worth it. 
            <br>
            Today, living in Toulouse, it is more complicated for me to practice this kind of sport if the opportunity arises, I will not hesitate to do it again.

        <h3> Land side </h3>
        <p class="block">
            In addition to having been lucky enough to grow up in an area close to the sea, I was also lucky enough to be close to the mountains. 
            This allowed me to do a lot of hiking in the Alps, all with a view of the sea. Just like water sports, I enjoy the freedom, calm and serenity that hiking offers. It's also an opportunity to take a good meal to eat with a great view.
            I'm now looking into hiking in the Toulouse area, I think I'll be served.
